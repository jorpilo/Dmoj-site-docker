Docker image for dmoj site

Right now this image builds a testing enviroment only! I am working to deploy a proper set up.

Right now the docker-compose build the image, the idea is once is done, to upload it to docker hub so it can be simply pulled.

## TO DO
 -  ~~Separate DB~~
 - ~~Persitance site~~
 - ~~Configuration of local settings~~

 - Maybe separate nginx and communicate using sockets
